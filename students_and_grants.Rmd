Not at all standardized

Closest to usable infromation from THES article, 2016
https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-grant-success-rates-prompt-worldwide-comparisons

Table : overall UK research council success rates 

```{r}
require(tidyverse)

overall_by_council <- tribble(
  ~council_name, ~n_applications, ~n_grants, ~success_pct, ~amount, 
  "Arts & Humanities Research Council", 246, 68, 28, 29851958,
  "Biotechnology & Biological Sciences Research Council", 1621, 392, 24, 178719000,
  "Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council", 2419, 786, 33, 509476006,
  "Economic & Social Research Council", 429, 52, 12, 24107303,
  "Medical Research Council", 1993, 402, 20, 283520000,
  "Natural Environment Research Council", 1036, 311, 30, 86871071
)
# For year 2016 
```
Now to plot this
```{r}
overall_by_council %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = forcats::fct_reorder(council_name, amount), y = amount)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip()+ 
  labs(x = )
```

Let's try a treemap

```{r}
require(treemap)
treemap(
  overall_by_council,
  index = "council_name",
  vSize = "amount",
  title ="Research funding by council in 2016"
  
)

```
 Now research grant success rates 
 
```{r}
overall_by_council %>% 
  mutate(success_rate = n_grants / n_applications) %>%  
  treemap(
    .,
    index = "council_name",
    vSize = "success_rate",
    title ="Grant success rates by council in 2016"
  
)
 
```

Now let's look at the number of students who enter each subject 

We have this data from the following location:

https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/11-01-2018/sfr247-higher-education-student-statistics/subjects

```{r}
read_csv(
  "data/sfr247-figure-14 (1).csv",
  skip = 13, col_names = F 
  ) -> tmp

tmp[1,1] <- "year"
tmp[1,2:5] <- 2012
tmp[1,6:9] <- 2013
tmp[1, 10:13] <- 2014
tmp[1, 14:17] <- 2015
tmp[1, 18:21] <- 2016
tmp
tmp2 <- tmp[-1,]
names(tmp2) <- tmp[1,]
tmp2

dta_tidy <- bind_rows(
  tmp %>% (function(..){
    .. %>% 
    select(X1:X5) %>% mutate(year = 2012) %>% slice(-c(1,2)) -> ..
    names(..) <- c("subject", "female", "male", "other", "total", "year")
    ..
  }),
  tmp %>% (function(..){
    .. %>% 
      select(X1, X6:X9) %>% mutate(year = 2013) %>% slice(-c(1,2)) -> ..
    names(..) <- c("subject", "female", "male", "other", "total", "year")
    ..
  }),
  tmp %>% (function(..){
    .. %>% 
      select(X1, X10:X13) %>% mutate(year = 2014) %>% slice(-c(1,2)) -> ..
    names(..) <- c("subject", "female", "male", "other", "total", "year")
    ..
  }),
  tmp %>% (function(..){
    .. %>% 
      select(X1, X10:X13) %>% mutate(year = 2014) %>% slice(-c(1,2)) -> ..
    names(..) <- c("subject", "female", "male", "other", "total", "year")
    ..
  }),
  tmp %>% (function(..){
    .. %>% 
      select(X1, X14:X17) %>% mutate(year = 2015) %>% slice(-c(1,2)) -> ..
    names(..) <- c("subject", "female", "male", "other", "total", "year")
    ..
  }),
    tmp %>% (function(..){
    .. %>% 
      select(X1, X18:X21) %>% mutate(year = 2016) %>% slice(-c(1,2)) -> ..
    names(..) <- c("subject", "female", "male", "other", "total", "year")
    ..
  })
) %>% 
  gather(female:total, key = gender, value = "number") %>% 
  mutate(number = number %>% 
           stringr::str_replace(",", "") %>%
           as.numeric
  )


```

Now to get a lookup for students to research council


```{r}

subject_council_lookup <- tribble(
  ~subject_name, ~council,
"(1) Medicine & dentistry", "mrc",
"(2) Subjects allied to medicine", "mrc",
"(3) Biological sciences", "bbsrc",
"(4) Veterinary science", "nerc",
"(5) Agriculture & related subjects", "nerc",
"(6) Physical sciences", "epsrc",
"(7) Mathematical sciences", "epsrc",
"(8) Computer science", "epsrc",
"(9) Engineering & technology", "epsrc",
"(A) Architecture, building & planning", "esrc",
"(B) Social studies", "esrc",
"(C) Law", "esrc",
"(D) Business & administrative studies", "esrc",
"(E) Mass communications & documentation", "esrc",
"(F) Languages", "ahrc",
"(G) Historical & philosophical studies", "arhc",
"(H) Creative arts & design", "ahrc",
"(I) Education", "esrc",
"(J) Combined", NA
)

council_abbreviation_lookup <- tribble(
  ~abbreviation, ~full_name,
  "mrc","Medical Research Council",
  "esrc", "Economic & Social Research Council",
  "epsrc","Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council",
  "nerc","Natural Environment Research Council",
  "ahrc", "Arts & Humanities Research Council",
  "bbsrc","Biotechnology & Biological Sciences Research Council"
)


```
Now let's try to join the data 
```{r}
subject_council_lookup %>% 
  inner_join(
    dta_tidy %>% 
      filter(year == 2016) %>% 
      filter(gender == "total"),
    by = c("subject_name"="subject")
    ) %>% 
  group_by(council) %>% 
  summarise(number = sum(number, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(council)) %>% 
  inner_join(
    council_abbreviation_lookup,
    by = c("council"="abbreviation")
  ) %>% 
  treemap(
    .,
    index = "full_name",
    vSize = "number",
    title ="Approximate number of students by research council area"
    
  )
    

```

Now let's look at association

```{r}

subject_council_lookup %>% 
  inner_join(
    dta_tidy %>% 
      filter(year == 2016) %>% 
      filter(gender == "total"),
    by = c("subject_name"="subject")
    ) %>% 
  group_by(council) %>% 
  summarise(number = sum(number, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(council)) %>% 
  inner_join(
    council_abbreviation_lookup,
    by = c("council"="abbreviation")
  ) %>% 
  left_join(
    overall_by_council %>% select(council_name, research_funding = amount), 
    by = c("full_name"="council_name")
  ) %>% 
  select(
    council_name = full_name,
    number_of_students = number, 
    research_funding
  ) %>% 
  left_join(
    council_abbreviation_lookup,
    by = c("council_name"="full_name")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(research_funding = research_funding / 1000000) %>% 
  mutate(number_of_students = number_of_students / 1000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = number_of_students, y = research_funding, label = abbreviation)) + 
  geom_label() +
  labs(y = "Research council funding  allocated in 2016 (Â£Millions)",
         x = "Number of students enrolling in 2016 (thousands)",
       title = "Differences between research fields: students vs research funds"
  )
